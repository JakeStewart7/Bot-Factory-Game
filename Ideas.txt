Ideas:
	-- Ally moveToTargetAction goes to building, ignoring other buildings
SPRINT


BACKLOG
1. Refactor Code
   -- Interfaces?
   -- Rethink code architecture
   -- Plan for scalability, testing
   -- Use of inheritance/polymorphism for units/buildings
   -- Reusable functions/logic for units, i.e. targetting scrap, firing, etc
   -- Cleaning up messy code / classes, condense if possible, performance

1. New name
2. Create title screen
3. Title screen music

PLAYTEST FEEDBACK
4. Balance player characters, 2 too strong
5. Select and change which building retrievers return to
6. More robot types
7. Ally retriever can also follow player and heal?
8. Upgrade ally robots or have a building that activates once has enough scrap?
9. Huge enemy boss out of regular sized base

GAMEPLAY ISSUES
1. -- Map feels too big ?
2. - Clearer indication of communication ability state change?
3. -- Feels like more beginning is needed
4. -- Needs more map awareness given to player
5. -- Player can backdoor, literally, somewhat easily
6. Too many ally retrievers
7. Retrievers not close enough to get scrap

Main Interest Points
1. Highly cooperative
2. Infrastructure building
3. Early struggle / grind
4. Automation
5. Critical mass for overwhelming victory

What's needed
1. Resource system
2. Bot functions
	Self building / factory building bots
3. Player functions
4. Conflict

Basic Concept
Players are faced against mass produced bots, must destroy them and
collect their scrap to build factories and produce own bots. Bots
will become autonomous and continue to expand your base

Key Ideas
Scrap - Spawns / Supply / From Robots
Players/Bots collect and return to base
Turrets?


Coop Ideas
Defender little robots always follow player, can shoot to send to ally

Misc. Ideas
Scrap falls from sky
Player - Homing Rocket Spray Ability
Units - (Flying?) Scrap Collectors
	- Defenders: defend bots that need it or base
Enemy Small Unit - Leap towards player with cooldown
		 - Charge after nearby scrap
Factories - Scrap turns into robots at factory
	    Random spawn, random number, controllable

Considered Ideas
Shoot own little robots to get them to follow you // What if OP?
Or shoot them to give them stat boost?
Small Ally Bots - Defend until following you
No factories, just switch what type of units being produced
Enemies die and produce a small unit that carries their scrap back
   - or separate unit comes with to collect scrap
Minimap - Small camera looking from afar or midpoint between players
	: Didn't work out too well, distracting, not much point.

Extra Ideas
Enemies blow up after a moment of 0 hp
	Make lasers come from eyes
	Attack Cooldown GUI timers (i.e. over/on unit or player?)
Conveyors of some sort
Music, Sound

TEST
Shockwave heal affects allies and other players but not self
Scrap touches base or player w/ scrap attached touches base, turn in
Shockwave

Known Issues
Shockwave: If target hits another object while knocked back, keeps velocity
Retrieving Scrap on top of unit after returning another piece of scrap

ScrapTransfer doesn't send to ally retrieval factory as expected, but
	uses "Ally Retrieval Factory" to find them, which might change
	or have (clone) on the end, etc.

Likewise, remember to change name of all created prefabs to get rid of extra
TransferScrap target with greater than 1 unit cost?

ScrapCollector script OnCollision, if (scrap != null.... removed
	 && !containsScrap(scrap)

-- Scrap can be blasted outside walls after it hits wall once
